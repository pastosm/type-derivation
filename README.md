# Type inference

Type inference is the process of finding a type for a Î» -term. 
This project implements a simple version of it. First, the lambda calculus is implemented. 
Next, functions to perform substitutions and unification are implemented.
Finally, the program defines a function to give a type to a derivation, if it can be typed.
